We are creating this project in 3 stages:-
  1) Simple Logrank Test
  2) Weighted Logrank Test
  3) Applications of Logrank Test

In the first stage, we have worked on the implementations of the following:
  1) Log-Rank Test from scratch for an example
  2) Log-Rank for various synthetic datasets (including Exponential, Lognormal, and Weibull)
  3) Power and Efficiency of the Log-Rank test for synthetic data generated
  4) Log-Rank and Power of the test for various Real World Datasets

In the second stage, we have considered various weighted versions of the Log-Rank test including Wilcoxon, Tarone-Ware and the Peto versions.
We have worked on the following implementations of 
  1) Weighted Log-Rank Test from scratch for an example
  2) Weighted Log-Rank for various synthetic datasets (including Exponential, Lognormal, and Weibull)
  3) Power and Efficiency of the Weighted Log-Rank test for synthetic data generated
  4) Weighted Log-Rank and Power of the test for various Real World Datasets
